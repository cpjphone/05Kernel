Kernel Module: lcm_info 

I write this module to show the lcm supported and lcm used information 
with proc files .

We can see the ancient code which to realize this function is too bad 
as the evil codeing style! I'd hate it! That is the reasion the module 
was written.

Now I get the LCM name which is used by the MTK implement.

By the way, you can see some code which is not useful to the proc files 
such as open read write lseek. They are the legacy of my cdev driver. 
Never mind.
